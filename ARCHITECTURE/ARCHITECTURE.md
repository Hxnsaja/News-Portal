## Main Components

### Frontend (React and Tailwind CSS)

**Purpose:**  
The frontend provides the user interface and handles routing within the web application.

**Features:**
- **Home Page:**  
  Displays a list of approved news posts with pagination.
- **Post Detail Page:**  
  Shows the full content of a news post.
- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  Allows admins to manage posts and users.
- **Moderator Dashboard:**  
  Enables moderators to manage their profiles and posts.
- **Authentication Pages:**  
  Includes login forms for users, moderators, and admins.

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

**Purpose:**  
The backend serves as the API server, handling business logic and requests from the frontend.

**Features:**

- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/posts`  
    Fetches approved posts for public view.
  - `GET /api/admin/posts`  
    Retrieves all posts for admin/moderator view.
  - `POST /api/admin/posts`  
    Adds a new post.
  - `PUT /api/admin/posts/:id`  
    Updates a post.
  - `DELETE /api/admin/posts/:id`  
    Deletes a post.
  - `PUT /api/admin/posts/:id/approve`  
    Approves a post.
- **Business Logic:**  
  Handles validation, authentication, and authorization.

### Database (MongoDB)

**Purpose:**  
Stores persistent data such as users, posts, roles, and permissions.

**Schema:**
- **Users Collection:**  
  Stores user information, including roles (admin, moderator, user).
- **Posts Collection:**  
  Stores news posts with fields like title, content, image, and approval status.
- **Roles Collection:**  
  Defines different roles and their permissions.

## Explanation of Data Flow

1. **User Input:**  
   Users interact with the frontend (React/Tailwind) by submitting forms or navigating through pages.

2. **Request Handling:**  
   The frontend sends HTTP/HTTPS requests to the backend API (Node.js/Express) to fetch or modify data.

3. **Backend Processing:**  
   The backend processes these requests, executes business logic, and performs operations on the database.  
   *Example:* When a user views a post, the frontend sends a `GET` request to the backend, which then queries the database and returns the post data to the frontend.

4. **Database Interaction:**  
   The backend interacts with the database to retrieve or store data.  
   *Example:* When a new post is added, the backend inserts the post data into the database.

5. **Response:**  
   The backend sends the processed data or confirmation back to the frontend. The frontend then updates the user interface based on the response.

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication:**  
   *JWT (JSON Web Tokens):* Used to authenticate users and manage sessions. Tokens are generated upon login and included in subsequent requests to validate the userâ€™s identity.

2. **Authorization:**  
   *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):* Implements different permissions for admins, moderators, and users.  
   *Example:*  
   - **Admins:** Can add, edit, delete, and approve posts; manage moderators.  
   - **Moderators:** Can add and edit posts but cannot delete or approve them once approved.  
   - **Users:** Can view posts and interact with the public area.

3. **Data Protection:**  
   - **HTTPS:** Ensures that data transmitted between the frontend and backend is encrypted and secure.  
   - **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data, such as user passwords, should be hashed and stored securely in the database.  
   - **Input Validation:** All user inputs should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
